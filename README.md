This lab went over the routine install for Windows Server 2022 in the VMware Workstation Hypervisor.
Beginning with a fresh install, and following setup guidelines, the virtual machine was configured and snapshotted at different instance points using Sysprep to allow consistent and efficient clone copies.

I think the most important thing I learned in this Windows Server 2022 setup is that this operating system defaults to the Administrator user. From the moment Windows is installed, Server Manager puts a lot of the tools and power at the Administrator's fingertips right away. Many of the steps from previous hypervisor labs, such as Services, local security policy, and computer name, are now found in the different server manager tools and properties tabs.
